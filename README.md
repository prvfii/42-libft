  	Your very first step into the world of C programming at 42!

Description

The libft project is one of the foundational projects at 42 School. Its goal is to reimplement a set of standard C library functions and extend them with custom utility functions. This library will serve as a personal toolkit to use in future projects during your journey at 42.

Goals

	•	Understand the inner workings of standard C library functions.
	•	Gain proficiency in memory management, pointers, and string manipulation.
	•	Develop clean, modular, and well-documented code.
	•	Create a reusable and extensible library for future projects.

Features

Part 1: Reimplementation of Standard C Library Functions

Functions from <ctype.h>, <string.h>, and <stdlib.h>, such as:
	•	Memory functions: memset, memcpy, memmove, memcmp, etc.
	•	String functions: strlen, strchr, strdup, strnstr, etc.
	•	Character checks: isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, toupper, etc.

Part 2: Additional Utility Functions

Custom functions to complement the standard library:
	•	Examples: ft_substr, ft_strjoin, ft_split, ft_itoa, etc.
